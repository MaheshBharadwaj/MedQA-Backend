Patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hypertension, lupus, asthma, and chronic renal insufficiency, may be at a higher risk for postoperative complications. In this case, considering the patient's medical complexity and the potential need for close monitoring postoperatively, it would be advisable to recommend an inpatient surgery for the laparoscopic myomectomy.
